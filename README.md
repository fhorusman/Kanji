Kanji

Kanji Flashcard Game

It was a game to help people memorize Kanji, by using quiz-like form to enrich learning experience.
Not only that, this game also provides statistic of playing score for each day you play the game.

To play the game, open the index.html on your browser. Allow to save on localStorage when prompted; the apps used localStorage to save your playing preferences and your playing score, so when you re-opened the apps, the preferences would be configured as it was when you last used it before.

Any suggestion or help to improve this game would be appreciated. Just send me message @fhorusman on twitter.
